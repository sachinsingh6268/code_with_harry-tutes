# it's same as the sets that we study in mathematics and same as we study hashset and unordered_set in java & cpp respectively
s=set()
# print(type(s))
l1=[2,34,52,532,23,2]
l2=[23,234,23423,5354,2342]
#making set using list
#s_from_list=set(l1)
#print(s_from_list)
# To add elements in the set
s.add(1)
#print(s)
s.add(1)
s.add(2)
s.add(3)
#print(s) #** set stores any value at most once as happens in the mathematical set or stores unique values only

# All funcionalities of a set are inbuilt here, we can directly use them to perform operations
#print(s.union([1,4]))
#s1=s.union({1,3,2,4,5})
#print(s,s1)
#s2=s.intersection({1,5,2,4,5})
#print(s2)

# calculation of length
#print(len(s))
# to find maximum among the elements in a set
#print(max(s))
# to find minimum element among the element in a set
#print(min(s))

# to check if two sets are disjoint or not
#print(s.isdisjoint(s1))

# To remove element from a set
# s.remove(1)
# print(s)

# SAME WAY ALL OTHER SET FUNCTIONALITIES CAN ALSO BE USED VERY EASILY HERE
