# HOW TO WORK WITH A FILE IN A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

# file IO basics
# there are two type of memories
# i) harddisk and ii) RAM memory
# RAM memory is volatile while harddisk memory is non-volatile
# volatile  --> means as we switch off the computer, the data in the RAM will be erased
# non-volatile --> means even after switching off the computer,the data will be there, saved for the long time
# In non-volatile memory ,the things are stored in the form of files and these are called files. these file may contain text, binary (image, MP3) or any form of data.



# HOW WE CAN OPEN A FILE IN DIFFERENT MODES
"""
"r"  -- open file for reading, *** IT'S DEFAULT MODE ***
"w"   --- open a file for writing
"x"(exclusive creation)  --- if file already exists,then this operation will fail, if file does not exist then this file will form OR creates file if not exists
"a"(append)    --- add more content to a file(to add to end of a file)
"t" (text)   --- text mode *** DEFAULT MODE ***
"b" (binary)   --- binary mode
"+"   ---- it's used to open file for both read and write both
